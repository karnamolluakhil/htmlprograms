<p>There are various methods of cooking aloo gosht.[4] Generally, the preparation method involves simmering lamb or beef pieces and potatoes over medium heat, with various spices.[6]

    Lamb or beef meat is cut into chunks and placed into a stew pot over heat. Chicken may be used as an alternative to lamb or beef. Tomatoes, along with cinnamon, bay leaves, ginger, garlic, red chili powder, cumin seeds, fried onions, black cardamom, garam masala and cooking oil are added and stirred.[4] Potatoes and salt are mixed in. Water is added, in a proportion that is enough to cover the meat, and brought to the boil. The aloo gosht is covered and left to simmer until the meat becomes tender. Once ready, it may be garnished with chopped coriander leaves and served hot.[2][4</p>

    <p>Cauliflower is the result of selective breeding and likely arose in the Mediterranean region, possibly from broccoli.[12]

        Pliny the Elder included cyma among cultivated plants he described in Natural History: "Ex omnibus brassicae generibus suavissima est cyma"[13] ("Of all the varieties of cabbage the most pleasant-tasted is cyma").[14] Pliny's description likely refers to the flowering heads of an earlier cultivated variety of Brassica oleracea.[15]
        
        In the Middle Ages, early forms of cauliflower were associated with the island of Cyprus, with the 12th- and 13th-century Arab botanists Ibn al-'Awwam and Ibn al-Baitar claiming its origin to be Cyprus.[16][17] This association continued into Western Europe, where cauliflowers were sometimes known as Cyprus colewort, and there was extensive trade in western Europe in cauliflower seeds from Cyprus, under the French Lusignan rulers of the island, until well into the 16th century.[18]
        
        It is thought to have been introduced into Italy from Cyprus or the east coast of the Mediterranean around 1490, and then spread to other European countries in the following centuries.</p>

    <p>Bhindi Fry (also called okra fry, bhendi fry, bhindi masala or bharwan bhindi) is stir-fried okra (ladies' finger) that is slit and stuffed with spice mix such as garam masala and other locally available ground spices.

        This dish is stir-fried or sautéed slightly, which is distinct from batter-fried okra, which involves deep frying.
        
        It can be served as a side dish in accompaniment with steamed rice and dal or with chapati as a form of sabzi.</p>

         mirchi ka salan
    </summary>
    <p>Mirchi ka salan is a traditional Hyderabadi dish prepared for weddings and special occasions. It is a spicy dish served with rice (either plain or spiced, like biryani rice) or chapati.[1] The mirchi (chilli peppers) are cooked in spices and mixed with a ground peanut paste which gives the dish a grainy texture. Sometimes the chillies can also be substituted with tomatoes (tamatey in Urdu) and eggplant (baigan in Urdu), which then becomes tamatey ka salan and baigan ka salan respectively.</p>

    <p>Chicken curry or curry/curried chicken is a South Asian dish originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is common in the cuisine of the Indian subcontinent, Caribbean, Southeast Asia, Great Britain, and Kenya. A typical curry from the Indian subcontinent consists of chicken stewed in an onion- and tomato-based sauce, flavoured with ginger, garlic, tomato puree, chilli peppers and a variety of spices, often including turmeric, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and cardamom. Outside of South Asia, chicken curry is often made with a pre-made spice mixture known as curry powder.
