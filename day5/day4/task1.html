         JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.</h3> <br>
<h3>lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_web_page " target ="_blank" title="Dynamic web page: example of server-side scripting (PHP and MySQL).

Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application">web Web_application</a> development around a single programming language, as opposed to using different languages for the server- versus client-side programming. </h3><br>
<h3>Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_communication">real-time Web applications </a>
